# Health Analytic Pipeline

This repository contains the Health Analytic Pipeline project. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for analyzing health-related data. This contains 6 individual pipelines in a variety of B2B and B2C use cases, to generate insight.
The first pipeline will perform beneficiary alanysis using the sample data retrieved from the CMS synpuf database. 20 sample files will have 5% of the total data. Any more would require an official license.
